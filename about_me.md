  Hey there! Here you can find out more about me. Think of this page as my online CV. If you are interested about anything you read, I'd enjoy getting in contact with you to discuss and collaborate!

## Summary

Final year software engineering undergraduate from the University of Queensland. I've always had a curious mind and an attraction to solving problems that require creativity and critical thinking to solve. I find myself interested in a lot of things, however I am particularly interested in Computer Networks, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. 

I was lucky enough to grow up speaking two languages, German and English. Understanding two different languages has always been a huge advantage and is a skill that I pride myself in having. I work well in teams as well as on my own, as I am quick to adapt and can learn quickly from others. 

Thanks for reading!
